# SwiftUI Sticky Header Experiment

In this project I tried to experiment with some features such as pinned views in section, `.coordinateSpace(name:)` view modifier, `.matchedGeometryEffect(id:in:)` view modifier.

This project is mostly inspired by [a video by Kavsoft on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATi5EnY5IYE) with some changes and additions.

## Testing the result

Just open **StickyHeader.xcodeproj** and change the bundle identifier and set the development team if necessary.

To see the final result, use a simulator or a real device since SwiftUI Previews' behavior is sometimes unexpected.

Build, run and enjoy.

## Consider before using in your app

- This project is not an example of how to prepare your design for dark mode.
- Not all views and other design elements are designed based on [Apple's Human Interface Guideline](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview).
